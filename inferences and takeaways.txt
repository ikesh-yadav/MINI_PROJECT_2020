//takeaways
Time spent by the student with group members matters to a extent good but spending too much time may be harmful as it takes away time for other activities, but very dependent on the individual.
Students can score good marks in many ways like attending classes regularly, spending more time in library, approaching faculties after classes, spending time with friends learning if they didnt attend classes, but to score high marks a student must have high attentiveness and have to study at home. Time spent on social media has less effect on the student performance if thier other parameters are good enough.
If a student scores good in the previous semesters then they are also very likely to score good in the current semester.
Time spent by students in library and visiting faculty only affect thier result if their study time and attentiveness is not high.
